YAGNI Principle — “You Aren’t Gonna Need It”

#Definition:
	A core Agile and Extreme Programming (XP) principle that says:
	Don’t add functionality until it is necessary.

#Key Idea:
	Avoid writing code for hypothetical future needs. Focus only on what the current requirements demand.

#Example:
	You think users might want dark mode later, so you build a theme engine now — YAGNI violation.

#Benefits:
	1. Keeps codebase simple and maintainable
	2. Reduces technical debt
	3. Saves development time

#When to Use:
	Always — unless the future feature is absolutely confirmed and imminent.

#Real-World Analogy:
	You don’t build a swimming pool just because you might learn swimming next year.
