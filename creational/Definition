Creational Design Patterns

#Definition

	Creational design patterns deals with object creation mechanisms, 
	trying to create objects in a controlled and flexible way.

	They abstract the instantiation process, making a system independent of how its objects are created, 
	composed, and represented.

#Objective

	1. Control object creation to avoid complex instantiation code scattered across the system.
	2. Promote flexibility by decoupling client code from concrete classes.
	3. Enable scalability by supporting easy addition of new types of objects.
	
#Real-World Analogy

	Think of a meal preparation system in a restaurant:
	
	1. A Factory decides what type of meal to prepare based on the order.
	2. A Builder assembles the meal step by step.
	3. A Singleton ensures there is only one cashier managing payments.
	4. A Prototype lets chefs duplicate existing dishes quickly.
	5. An Abstract Factory lets the chef prepare families of meals (e.g., vegetarian vs non-vegetarian).

#Benefits

	1. Reduces tight coupling between client and concrete classes.
	2. Improves code flexibility for future changes.
	3. Promotes reusability by centralizing object creation logic.
	4. Supports scalability by making it easier to add new types of objects.
