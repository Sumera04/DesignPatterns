Prototype Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer
	
	The Prototype Pattern is a Creational Design Pattern that allows you to create 
	new objects by cloning existing ones instead of creating them from scratch.
	It’s used when object creation is costly or complex, and you want to avoid 
	reinitializing the same data repeatedly.

#Key Idea:
	Define a prototype interface with a clone() method. Objects that implement it can 
	copy themselves to produce new instances.

#Example:
	Creating multiple copies of a Document or Shape object with the same properties but independent states.

#Principles Used:
	1. Avoids direct instantiation (reduces coupling to concrete classes)
	2. Promotes flexibility by cloning existing instances

#When to Use:
	When object creation is expensive, repetitive, or dependent on complex configuration.

#Pros:
	1. Reduces overhead of creating complex objects
	2. Simplifies object creation logic
	3. Cloning can include or exclude deep object properties

#Cons:
	1. Deep copy implementation can be complex
	2. Cloning may break encapsulation if not carefully handled
