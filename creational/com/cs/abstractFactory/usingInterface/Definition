Abstract Factory Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Abstract Factory Pattern is a Creational Design Pattern that provides an interface 
	for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
	It’s often called a “factory of factories.”

#Key Idea:
	Each concrete factory implements an abstract interface that creates multiple related 
	objects (products) that are designed to work together.
	The client only interacts with the abstract interfaces, not the concrete classes.

#Example:
	1. A GUIFactory can create related UI elements like Button and Checkbox.
	2. WindowsFactory creates WindowsButton, WindowsCheckbox.
	3. MacFactory creates MacButton, MacCheckbox.

#Principles Used:
	1. Dependency Inversion Principle (client depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations)
	2. Open/Closed Principle (can add new product families without modifying existing code)
	3. Encapsulation of object creation

#When to Use:
	When your system needs to create related or dependent objects that must be used together, 
	and you want to ensure consistency among products.

#Pros:
	1. Ensures compatibility among related objects
	2. Isolates product creation logic from client code
	3. Makes it easy to introduce new product families

#Cons:
	1. Adding a new product type requires changing all factory classes
	2. Increases complexity due to multiple factory hierarchies
