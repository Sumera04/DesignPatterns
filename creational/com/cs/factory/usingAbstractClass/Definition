Factory Method Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Factory Method Pattern is a Creational Design Pattern that provides an interface for creating objects,
	but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
	It helps in creating objects without exposing the creation logic to the client.

#Key Idea:
	Define a method (factory) that returns an object of a common interface or abstract class, allowing 
	subclasses to decide the concrete type.

#Example:
	A `DocumentFactory` class that creates `Word`, `PDF`, or `Excel` document objects based on input — 
	the client only interacts with the `DocumentFactory` interface.

#Principles Used:
	1. Encapsulation of object creation logic
	2. Open/Closed Principle (new products can be added without changing existing code)
	3. Dependency Inversion Principle (client depends on abstractions, not concrete classes)

#When to Use:
	When object creation involves logic or conditions that shouldn’t be exposed to the client, 
	or when you want to delegate instantiation to subclasses.

#Pros:
	1. Centralizes and controls object creation
	2. Reduces tight coupling between client and concrete classes
	3. Improves code maintainability and scalability

#Cons:
	1. Adds extra classes and complexity
	2. Can lead to subclass explosion if not managed well
