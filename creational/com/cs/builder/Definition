Builder Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Builder Pattern is a Creational Design Pattern that separates the construction of 
	a complex object from its representation, allowing you to create different types and 
	representations of an object using the same construction process.

#Key Idea:
	Instead of using a complex constructor with many parameters, a Builder object constructs 
	the final product step by step, offering better readability and flexibility.

#Example:
	Building a House with optional features like garage, garden, and swimmingPool.
	You can use a HouseBuilder to construct different variants (e.g., LuxuryHouse, EcoHouse) step by step.

#Principles Used:

	1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The builder handles object construction separately from representation.
	2. Encapsulation: Hides complex construction logic from the client.
	3. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): You can introduce new builders without changing existing client code.

#When to Use:
	When you need to create complex objects with optional or varying configurations, 
	especially when many constructor parameters make the code hard to read.

#Pros:
	1. Makes object construction flexible and readable
	2. Allows step-by-step creation and reuse of construction logic
	3. Supports different representations of the same object

#Cons:
	1. Requires additional classes (builder, director)
	2. Slightly increases code complexity for simple objects
