Singleton Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer
	
	The Singleton Pattern is a Creational Design Pattern that ensures only one instance of a class 
	exists throughout the application and provides a global access point to it.

#Key Idea:
	Restrict class instantiation by making the constructor private and exposing a static method that 
	returns the same instance every time.

#Example:
	A DatabaseConnection or Logger class where having multiple instances could cause conflicts or inefficiency.

#Principles Used:

	1. Controlled object creation
	2. Global point of access (via a static method)
	3. Can use lazy initialization for resource efficiency


# When to Use:
	When exactly one instance of a class is required (e.g., configuration manager, thread pool, logging service).
	
#Pros:
	1. Ensures single shared instance
	2. Saves system resources
	3. Provides global access point

#Cons:

	1. Difficult to test (introduces global state)
	2. Can violate Single Responsibility Principle
	3.May cause concurrency issues if not thread-safe
