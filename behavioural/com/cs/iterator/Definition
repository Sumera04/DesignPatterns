Iterator Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Iterator Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that provides a standard way to access elements 
	of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation (like array, list, or tree).

#Key Idea:
	It separates the traversal logic from the collection object, allowing different ways to iterate over the 
	same data structure.

#Example:
	A BookCollection class provides an Iterator to access each Book object one by one, without exposing 
	internal storage details.

#Principles Used:

	1. Single Responsibility Principle: Iterator handles traversal, collection handles data.
	2. Encapsulation: Internal structure of the collection remains hidden.

#When to Use:
	When you need to traverse complex data structures without exposing their internals or when you want 
	multiple ways to iterate over a collection.

#Pros:
	1. Simplifies traversal of complex structures.
	2. Supports multiple simultaneous traversals.
	3. Promotes encapsulation and clean separation of concerns.

#Cons:
	1. Adds extra classes.
	2. Can be less efficient for very simple collections.

#Real-World Analogy:
	A TV remote — you can move channel by channel without knowing how the channels are stored inside the TV.
