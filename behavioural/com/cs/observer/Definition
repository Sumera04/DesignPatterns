Observer Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer
	The Observer Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that defines a one-to-many 
	dependency between objects so that when one object (the Subject) changes its state, 
	all its dependent objects (Observers) are automatically notified and updated.

#Key Idea:
	The Subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any state change — typically 
	by calling their update() method.

#Example:
	In a stock price app, when the stock value changes (Subject), all registered displays or 
	users (Observers) get real-time updates.

#Principles Used:
	1. Loose Coupling: Subject and observers interact through an interface, not concrete classes.
	2. Open/Closed Principle: New observers can be added without modifying existing code.
	3. Dependency Inversion Principle: Both Subject and Observer depend on abstractions.

#When to Use:
	When multiple objects need to stay in sync with the state of another object, such as in 
	event-driven systems, GUIs, or notification systems.

#Pros:
	1. Promotes loose coupling between Subject and Observers
	2. Automatically propagates state changes
	3. Easy to add new observers

#Cons:
	1. Can cause unexpected updates if observers are not managed properly
	2. Order of notification can become unpredictable

#Real-World Analogy:
	You subscribe to a YouTube channel — whenever the creator uploads a video, all subscribers (observers) 
	are notified automatically.
