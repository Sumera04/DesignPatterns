Visitor Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Visitor Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that lets you add new operations to existing 
	object structures without modifying their classes. It achieves this by using a visitor object 
	that performs operations on elements of an object structure via double dispatch.

#Key Idea:
	Keep the data structure (elements) and the operations (visitors) separate so that you can add new operations easily.

#Example:
	A shopping cart where books, fruits, and clothes calculate prices differently using a visitor class.

#Principles Used:
	1. Open/Closed Principle: Add new operations without changing existing classes.
	2. Single Responsibility Principle: Elements hold data; visitors define behavior.

#When to Use:
	When the class structure is stable, but you need to add operations frequently.

#Pros:
	1. Easy to add new operations.
	2. Centralizes behavior related to a set of classes.

#Cons:
	1. Adding new element types requires updating all visitors.

#Real-World Analogy:
	A customs officer (visitor) inspects different items (elements) — each item accepts the visitor, 
	and the visitor applies inspection logic based on the item type.
