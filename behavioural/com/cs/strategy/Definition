Strategy Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

The Strategy Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that defines a family of algorithms, 
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

It lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

#Key Idea:
Instead of using if-else or switch to choose behavior, each algorithm is placed in its own 
class implementing a common interface. The context class delegates the task to the selected strategy object.

#Example:
A payment system where PaymentStrategy defines pay(amount) and concrete strategies 
include CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, and UPIPayment.
The client can choose any payment method at runtime.

#Principles Used:
1. Open/Closed Principle: New strategies can be added without changing existing code.
2. Single Responsibility Principle: Each strategy handles one algorithm.
3. Dependency Inversion Principle: Context depends on the strategy interface, not concrete classes.
4. Composition over Inheritance: Behavior is composed dynamically.

#When to Use:
When multiple algorithms can perform a task and the choice may change at 
runtime (e.g., sorting methods, payment modes, route planning).

#Pros:
1. Removes conditional logic
2. Easy to add new algorithms
3. Promotes flexibility and cleaner code

#Cons:
1. Increases number of classes
2. Client must know available strategies

#Real-World Analogy:
A navigation app that can switch between “fastest route”, “shortest route”, or 
“avoid tolls” — same goal, different strategies.
