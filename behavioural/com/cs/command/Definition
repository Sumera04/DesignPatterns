Command Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Command Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, 
	allowing you to parameterize, queue, undo, or log operations independently of the object that invokes them.

#Key Idea:
	It separates the sender (who issues a request) from the receiver (who performs the action) by 
	introducing a command object that represents the request.

#Example:
	A remote control sends commands like TurnOnLight or TurnOffTV.
	Each button press is mapped to a command object that knows which receiver to act upon.

#Principles Used:
	1. Single Responsibility Principle: Each command represents one action.
	2. Open/Closed Principle: New commands can be added without changing existing code.
	3. Decoupling: The invoker doesn’t need to know the action details.

#When to Use:
	When you need to decouple senders from receivers, support undo/redo, or queue requests 
	(e.g., GUI buttons, transaction systems).

#Pros:

	1. Enables undo/redo functionality.
	2. Supports command queuing, logging, and macros.
	3. Promotes loose coupling between invoker and receiver.

#Cons:
	
	1. Increases the number of classes.
	2. Can be complex for simple operations.

#Real-World Analogy:
	A waiter taking an order — the waiter (invoker) doesn’t cook, just passes the command (order) 
	to the chef (receiver), who executes it.
