State Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The State Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that allows an object to change its behavior 
	dynamically when its internal state changes — as if the object’s class itself changed.

#Key Idea:
	It encapsulates state-specific behavior into separate classes, and the context delegates behavior
	 to the current state object.

#Example:
	A traffic light changes behavior (Red → Yellow → Green) based on its current state.
	Similarly, a media player behaves differently in Play, Pause, or Stop states.

#Principles Used:
	1. Single Responsibility Principle: Each state handles one behavior type.
	2. Open/Closed Principle: New states can be added without modifying existing code.
	3. Encapsulation: State-specific logic is localized in its class.

#When to Use:
	When an object’s behavior depends on its state, and it must change behavior at runtime without large conditionals.

#Pros:
	1. Eliminates long if-else/switch statements.
	2. Makes transitions and behavior easy to maintain.
	3. Improves code readability and scalability.

#Cons:
	1. Introduces many small classes.
	2. Can be overkill for simple scenarios.

#Real-World Analogy:
	A vending machine — its behavior changes depending on whether it’s waiting for coins, dispensing an item, 
	or out of stock.
