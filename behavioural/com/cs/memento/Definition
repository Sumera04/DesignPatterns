Memento Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Memento Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that lets you capture and restore an object’s internal state without exposing its internal details. It’s commonly used to implement undo/redo or rollback functionality.

#Key Idea:
	Save the state of an object (Originator) in a separate Memento object, and let a Caretaker manage these snapshots for later restoration.

#Example:
	A text editor saves document versions — pressing Ctrl+Z restores the previous state.

#Principles Used:
	1. Encapsulation: Internal state is stored privately in the Memento.
	2. Single Responsibility Principle: Each class (Originator, Memento, Caretaker) has one role.

#When to Use:
	When you need to implement undo/redo, checkpoints, or version history without breaking encapsulation.

#Pros:
	1. Enables safe state restoration.
	2. Preserves object encapsulation.

Cons:
	1. Can increase memory usage with many snapshots.


#Real-World Analogy:
	A video game’s save game feature — restores the exact state of the game when reloaded.
