Mediator Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Mediator Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that centralizes communication between multiple 
	objects (colleagues) so that they don’t communicate directly, reducing dependencies and tight coupling.

#Key Idea:
	Instead of objects calling each other directly, they interact through a mediator that controls and 
	coordinates their communication.

#Example:
	An air traffic control system — all airplanes (colleagues) communicate only with the control 
	tower (mediator), not with each other.

#Principles Used:
	1. Loose Coupling: Reduces direct dependencies between communicating objects.
	2. Single Responsibility Principle: Each colleague focuses on its core logic; the mediator handles coordination.
	3. Open/Closed Principle: You can add new colleagues without modifying others.

#When to Use:
	When you have many interacting objects with complex communication logic that would otherwise lead to 
	tight coupling or spaghetti code.

#Pros:
	1. Reduces complexity of object interconnections.
	2. Centralizes communication control.
	3. Improves maintainability and scalability.

#Cons:
	1.The mediator can become overly complex if it takes on too much logic.

#Real-World Analogy:
	A chat room — users (colleagues) don’t message each other directly; the chat server (mediator) routes all messages.
