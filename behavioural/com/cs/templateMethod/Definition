Template Method Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer
	The Template Method Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that defines the skeleton of an 
	algorithm in a base class while allowing subclasses to override specific steps without changing 
	the overall structure.

#Key Idea:
	The parent class provides a template method that outlines a fixed sequence of steps. Subclasses 
	implement or customize individual steps.

#Example:
	A DataProcessor class defines the flow: loadData() → parseData() → processData() → saveData().
	Subclasses like CSVDataProcessor and JSONDataProcessor provide their own implementations for these steps.

#Principles Used:
1. Open/Closed Principle: Base algorithm is fixed; steps can be customized via subclassing.
2. Hollywood Principle: “Don’t call us, we’ll call you” — parent class controls the sequence.
3. Inversion of Control: Parent decides when subclass methods are called.

#When to Use:
	When multiple classes follow the same process structure but differ in certain steps 
	(e.g., data parsing, report generation).

#Pros:
1. Promotes code reuse and consistency.
2. Reduces duplication across similar algorithms.
3. Enforces a standard process flow.

#Cons:
1. Relies on inheritance, limiting runtime flexibility.
2. Harder to modify if algorithm steps become too interdependent.

#Real-World Analogy:
	A cooking recipe template — steps like “prepare”, “cook”, and “serve” are fixed, but each dish 
	customizes them differently.
