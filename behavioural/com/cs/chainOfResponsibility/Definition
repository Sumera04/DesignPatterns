Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer
	The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that allows a request 
	to be passed along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides whether to process the 
	request or pass it to the next one in the chain.

#Key Idea:
	Decouple senders and receivers — the sender doesn’t know which handler will handle the request. 
	Each handler only knows its successor in the chain.

Example:
	A logging system where requests go through multiple loggers (ErrorLogger → FileLogger → ConsoleLogger), 
	and each decides whether to handle or forward the message.
	Another example: a support system where requests move from “Level 1 Support” to “Level 2” to “Manager.”

#Principles Used:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each handler focuses on one type of request.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): New handlers can be added without changing existing ones.
3. Loose Coupling: Sender and receivers are decoupled — only linked through the chain.

#When to Use:
	When multiple objects might handle a request, and you don’t want the sender to know which one will handle it.

#Pros:
	1. Promotes flexibility and decoupling between sender and receiver.
	2. Easy to add or reorder handlers.
	3. Reduces if-else chains or switch statements.


#Cons:
	1. Request may go unhandled if no handler processes it.
	2. Can be hard to debug if the chain is long or dynamic.

#Real-World Analogy:
	Customer service escalation — your complaint goes from customer care → supervisor → manager 
	until someone resolves it.
