Interpreter Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Interpreter Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that defines a grammar for a language and 
	uses interpreter objects to interpret (evaluate) sentences in that language.

#Key Idea:
	Represent rules of a simple language as classes, where each class interprets a specific part 
	of the grammar (like terminal or non-terminal expressions).

#Example:
	A rule-based command processor (e.g., “A AND B” or “A OR B”) that interprets and evaluates logical expressions.

#Principles Used:
	1. Single Responsibility Principle: Each expression class handles one grammar rule.
	2. Open/Closed Principle: You can extend grammar by adding new expression classes.

#When to Use:
	When you have to parse and evaluate expressions defined by a simple grammar — such as configuration 
	scripts, mathematical formulas, or search filters.

#Pros:
	1. Easy to change or extend grammar.
	2. Makes the language structure explicit.

#Cons:
	Complex grammars lead to many small classes, making it hard to maintain.

#Real-World Analogy:
	A language translator — each word (terminal expression) and rule (non-terminal expression) is 
	interpreted according to grammar to produce meaning.
