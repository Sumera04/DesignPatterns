Behavioral Design Patterns
#Definition

	Behavioral design patterns deals with communication and responsibility between objects.
	They focus on how objects interact, how responsibilities are assigned, and how algorithms 
	or workflows are implemented in a flexible way.

	In other words, behavioral patterns define the way objects collaborate to achieve a task, 
	making the system more maintainable and extensible.

#Objective

	1. Define clear responsibilities between objects.
	2. Promote loose coupling by encapsulating how objects communicate.
	3. Simplify complex control flows or algorithms by distributing behavior.
	4. Enable flexible and reusable interactions between objects.
	
#Real-World Analogy

	Think of an office workflow system:
	
	Observer: Employees get notified when the manager posts updates.
	Strategy: Different employees use different strategies to handle tasks.
	Command: Requests for approvals are encapsulated and can be queued or undone.
	Mediator: HR manages communication between departments to avoid direct messaging.

#Benefits
	
	1. Promotes loose coupling between interacting objects.
	2. Makes algorithms and workflows reusable and flexible.
	3. Simplifies complex behavior and control flow in a system.
	4. Improves maintainability and readability of interactions.
