#Composite Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Composite Pattern is a Structural Design Pattern that lets you treat individual objects and 
	groups of objects uniformly.
	It’s used to represent part-whole hierarchies, such as an organization chart or file system.

#Key Idea:
	Both simple objects (leaves) and complex objects (composites) implement the same interface, 
	allowing clients to perform common operations (like showDetails() or display()) without 
	worrying about whether they’re dealing with one object or a group.

#Example:
	In a company hierarchy, a Manager (composite) can contain multiple Employees (leaves), 
	but both expose the same method like showDetails().

#Principles Used:

	1. Composition over inheritance
	2. Open/Closed Principle
	3. Liskov Substitution Principle

#When to Use:
	When your system involves tree-like structures and you want to treat all nodes (individual or groups) 
	the same way.

#Pros:

	1. Uniformity between leaf and composite
	2. Simplifies client code
	3. Easy to extend

#Cons:

	1. Can make design overly general
	2. May allow invalid operations on leaf nodes
