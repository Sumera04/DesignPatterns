#Bridge Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Bridge Pattern is a Structural Design Pattern that separates an abstraction 
	from its implementation so that both can evolve independently.

#Key Idea:
	Instead of binding an abstraction (like Shape) and its implementation (like DrawingAPI) 
	through inheritance, the Bridge pattern uses composition — the abstraction “has-a” reference to the implementation.

#Example:
	A Circle (abstraction) can use different rendering APIs (OpenGLAPI, DirectXAPI) without changing its code.

#Principles Used:

	1. Composition over inheritance
	2. Open/Closed Principle
	3. Single Responsibility Principle
	4. Dependency Inversion Principle

#When to Use:
	When you have multiple dimensions of variation (e.g., shape type and rendering type) 
	and want to avoid a class explosion of combinations.

#Pros:

	1. Abstraction and implementation can change independently
	2. Reduces subclass proliferation
	3. Improves flexibility and maintainability

#Cons:

	Increases complexity (more interfaces and classes)
