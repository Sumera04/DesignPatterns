Adapter Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Adapter Pattern is a Structural Design Pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge between them.
	It converts one interface into another that a client expects, without modifying existing code.

#Key Idea:
	The Adapter wraps an existing class (the adaptee) and translates its interface to match the one the client needs.

#Example:
	An AudioPlayer supports only MP3, but using a MediaAdapter, it can also play VLC or MP4 files.

#Principles Used:

	1. Single Responsibility Principle (adapter only converts interface)
	2. Open/Closed Principle (existing classes aren’t modified)
	3. Dependency Inversion Principle (client depends on abstraction, not concrete class)

#When to Use:
	When you want to reuse existing classes that don’t match the required interface.

#Pros:

	1. Enables integration of incompatible interfaces
	2. Promotes code reuse
	3. Reduces coupling between systems

#Cons:

	1. Adds an extra layer of abstraction
	2. May make code harder to understand due to additional wrapping
