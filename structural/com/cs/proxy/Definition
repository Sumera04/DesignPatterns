Proxy Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Proxy Pattern is a Structural Design Pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder 
	for another object to control access to it.
	It acts as a middle layer between the client and the real object, adding extra functionality 
	like access control, caching, logging, or lazy initialization.

#Key Idea:
	The Proxy implements the same interface as the real subject and forwards requests to 
	it—optionally performing some extra operations before or after the call.

#Example:
	A ProxyImage class loads an image from disk only when needed, while the client interacts with 
	it as if it were a normal Image object.
	Another example: InternetProxy that blocks access to certain websites.

#Principles Used:
	1. Encapsulation: Hides complexities or sensitive access behind the proxy.
	2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Proxy adds only control logic; the real object handles core behavior.
	3. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): New proxy types can be added without modifying the real subject.

#Types of Proxy:
	1. Virtual Proxy: Delays expensive object creation (lazy loading).
	2. Remote Proxy: Manages communication with remote objects.
	3. Protection Proxy: Controls access rights to the real object.
	4. Caching Proxy: Caches results for repeated requests.

#When to Use:
	When direct access to an object is expensive, restricted, or needs additional control.

#Pros:
	1. Adds extra behavior without changing the real object
	2. Supports lazy loading, caching, logging, access control
	3. Hides network or resource management details from client

Cons:
	1. Increases complexity and layers of abstraction
	2. May add performance overhead
	3. Requires careful synchronization if used in multithreaded contexts
