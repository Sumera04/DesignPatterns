Decorator Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer
	The Decorator Pattern is a Structural Design Pattern that lets you dynamically add new behavior 
	or responsibilities to an object without modifying its existing code or subclassing it.

#Key Idea:
	Wrap the original object inside another object (decorator) that adds extra functionality while 
	keeping the same interface.
	Multiple decorators can be stacked for layered behavior.

#Example:
	A Coffee object can be wrapped by decorators like MilkDecorator, SugarDecorator, 
	or WhipCreamDecorator to add features dynamically without altering the base Coffee class.

#Principles Used:
	1. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): You can extend functionality without modifying existing classes.
	2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each decorator adds one specific behavior.
	3. Composition over Inheritance: Decorators use object composition rather than subclassing.

#When to Use:
	When you need to add responsibilities to individual objects at runtime rather than to an entire class hierarchy.

#Pros:
	1. Adds or removes functionality at runtime
	2. Avoids large subclass hierarchies
	3. Promotes code reusability and flexibility

#                                                                                                              Cons:
	1. Can lead to many small objects (complex debugging)
	2. Order of decorators may affect behavior
