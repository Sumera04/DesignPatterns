Flyweight Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Flyweight Pattern is a Structural Design Pattern that helps minimize memory usage by 
	sharing common data between multiple objects instead of storing duplicate data in each one.

#Key Idea:
	Separate the object’s state into:
	Intrinsic state – shared, immutable data (stored in Flyweight).
	Extrinsic state – context-specific data (supplied by the client).
	This allows sharing the intrinsic part across many fine-grained objects.

#Example:
	In a text editor, each character object shares the same font and style data (intrinsic), 
	while its position in the document (extrinsic) is stored separately.

#Principles Used:
	1. Memory Optimization via Object Sharing
	2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Flyweight stores only shared data; context holds unique data.
	3. Encapsulation: Client manages external state, flyweight hides internal details.

#When to Use:
	When you have a large number of similar objects that cause high memory usage, and 
	many of them share common data.

#Pros:
	1. Reduces memory footprint significantly
	2. Improves performance for large-scale object creation
	3. Encourages data sharing and reusability

Cons:
	1. Increased code complexity (splitting intrinsic/extrinsic state)
	2. Requires careful management of external state
	3. Harder to debug due to shared mutable data risks
