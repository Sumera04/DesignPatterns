Facade Design Pattern — Short Interview Answer

	The Facade Pattern is a Structural Design Pattern that provides a unified, 
	simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with the system.

#Key Idea:
	The Facade class wraps multiple complex classes and exposes a single, easy-to-use interface 
	that performs high-level operations, hiding the subsystem’s internal complexity.

#Example:
	A HomeTheaterFacade can provide a single method like watchMovie() that internally coordinates 
	Projector, Amplifier, DVDPlayer, and Lights classes.

#Principles Used:
	1. Encapsulation: Hides subsystem complexity behind a simple interface.
	2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Facade handles communication between client and subsystems.
	3. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Client depends on Facade abstraction, not subsystem details.

#When to Use:
	When you want to simplify interactions with complex systems or provide a single entry 
	point to a layered system (e.g., APIs, frameworks, libraries).

#Pros:
	1. Simplifies client usage of complex systems
	2. Reduces coupling between client and subsystem classes
	3. Improves code readability and maintainability

#Cons:
	1. Can become a god object if it grows too large
	2. May hide necessary details that advanced clients might need
