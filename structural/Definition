Structural Design Patterns
 
#Definition
 
	Structural design patterns are design patterns that deal with object composition and relationships, 
	helping to form larger structures from individual objects while keeping them flexible and efficient.

	In other words, they focus on how classes and objects are composed to build complex structures.
 
#Objective

	1. Simplify relationships between objects
	2. Promote reusability and flexibility
	3. Make it easier to change or extend system structure without major refactoring

#Real-World Analogy
 
	Think of building blocks or LEGO bricks: individual blocks can be combined in different ways 
	to build complex structures, and structural patterns show the best ways to connect or decorate 
	these blocks efficiently.
 
#Benefits
 
	1. Promotes code reusability
	2. Simplifies complex systems
	3. Enables flexible and maintainable object composition
	4. Reduces tight coupling between classes
